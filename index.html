      <section>
        <h2>Authority &amp; Scope</h2>

        <p>
          AVRS is core decision-tracking architecture built for accountability when decisions matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          In most systems, decisions happen without a clear, durable explanation of why they were allowed or what
          information existed at the time. When records do exist, they’re often technical artifacts that only
          specialists can interpret.
        </p>

        <p>
          AVRS sits underneath decision-making systems to close that gap. Before a decision proceeds, AVRS checks
          whether the decision can be justified based on the rules and constraints provided to it. If it can’t, the
          system stops instead of guessing.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a decision does go through, AVRS records what happened in a form that can be read and understood
          without an IT background, while still being verifiable and auditable later.
        </p>

        <p>
          AVRS does not independently approve decisions. Every decision must pass through a human-defined verification
          process. AVRS enforces declared constraints and records outcomes, but final authority remains with human
          operators.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why this exists</h2>

        <p>
          AVRS exists because critical decisions are routinely made without a durable, understandable record of why
          they were allowed at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          When those decisions are later questioned, teams are forced to reconstruct intent from partial logs, tickets,
          emails, or memory. The context that actually mattered at the moment of action is often gone.
        </p>

        <p>This turns review into interpretation instead of evidence.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The failure this prevents</h2>

        <p>
          When something goes wrong, accountability often collapses into availability instead of facts. Decisions are
          reconstructed after the fact from incomplete records, or from whoever happens to be present to explain them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Someone who wasn’t involved ends up responsible for justifying a decision they didn’t make, using records
          that don’t show why it was allowed. Meanwhile, the actual decision context is missing.
        </p>

        <p>
          AVRS exists to prevent that situation by recording decision context at the moment it occurs, so
          accountability is based on evidence instead of reconstruction.
        </p>

        <h2>What AVRS is — and what it is not</h2>

        <h3>What AVRS is</h3>

        <p>AVRS is core decision-tracking and verification architecture.</p>

        <p>
          It enforces declared rules at runtime and records whether decisions complied with those rules based on the
          information available at the time. It produces durable, human-readable records that explain what decision was
          made, under what constraints, and why the system proceeded or stopped.
        </p>

        <p>AVRS exists to make decision-making observable, reviewable, and defensible.</p>

        <h3>What AVRS is not</h3>

        <p>AVRS does not decide what is correct, ethical, or desirable.</p>

        <p>
          It does not invent approval criteria, infer intent, or apply judgment. Rules, policies, and constraints are
          defined by the organization using the system. AVRS enforces those declared constraints and records the
          outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the rules provided are incomplete, inconsistent, or flawed, AVRS will enforce them faithfully and expose
          that fact. It does not compensate for bad policy, and it does not hide it.
        </p>

        <p>AVRS is not an AI decision-maker, an optimization engine, or a replacement for human judgment.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Where approval context comes from</h2>

        <p>
          Approval criteria come from explicit inputs supplied by the system or organization using AVRS, such as
          policies, rules, thresholds, or declared intents.
        </p>

        <p>
          AVRS checks whether a decision complied with those inputs. If compliance cannot be verified, the system stops
          instead of guessing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Human verification is required</h2>

        <p>AVRS does not replace human judgment.</p>

        <p>
          Any decision enforced or recorded by AVRS must pass through a human-defined verification process. AVRS ensures
          that decisions are checked against declared rules and constraints, but it does not authorize decisions on its
          own.
        </p>

        <p>Humans remain responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>defining approval criteria</li>
          <li>reviewing outcomes</li>
          <li>accepting or rejecting decisions</li>
          <li>changing or revoking policies over time</li>
        </ul>

        <p>AVRS exists to make that human verification visible, consistent, and defensible.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What this page does not claim</h2>

        <p>AVRS does not promise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>correct decisions</li>
          <li>ethical outcomes</li>
          <li>prevention of all failures</li>
          <li>elimination of human responsibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It promises clarity, evidence, and accountability at the moment decisions are made.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Implementation status</h2>

        <p>
          AVRS is implemented in Kotlin, with core modules proven in production environments. The architecture
          integrates with JVM-based systems and supports extension to other platforms through Kotlin Multiplatform.

        <h2>Final reality check (the quiet kind)</h2>

        <p>This page does not try to impress. It does not sell miracles. It does not borrow authority from myth, AI, or vibes.</p>

        <p>
          What it does is harder: it states boundaries, names failure, and tells the truth about responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>That’s why people will get interested. Not excited. Interested.</p>
